TASK -2 - DEEP LEARNING PROJECT

IMPLEMENT A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING USING TENSORFLOW OR PYTORCH

DELIVERABLE: A FUNCTIONAL MODEL WITH VISUALIZATIONS OF RESULTS.


Requirements:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
For image classification: Use datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom datasets.
For NLP: Use datasets like IMDB, Twitter Sentiment, or custom text data.

Model Development:
Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for building CNN (for images) or LSTM/Transformer models (for NLP).

Training and Evaluation:
Train the model on training data.
Use metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix for evaluation.

Result Visualization:
Plot loss and accuracy curves.
Visualize feature maps or attention mechanisms.

Save and Deploy Model:
Save the trained model.
Deploy it using Flask or FastAPI for inference.
